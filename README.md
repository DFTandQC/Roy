# üåç AtmoAI: An AI-Powered System for Atmospheric Anomaly Detection and Forecasting

## üí° Project Idea

**AtmoAI** is an artificial intelligence project designed to detect anomalies in atmospheric data and improve short-term predictions of atmospheric conditions. The idea is to use machine learning to support environmental monitoring by identifying unexpected pollution events, unusual aerosol behavior, or rapid shifts in meteorological variables.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Atmospheric scientists rely on numerical models and observational data to track the state of the atmosphere. However, these models often:
- Struggle with localized anomalies (e.g., pollution spikes or wildfire plumes)
- Require significant computational resources
- May miss non-linear or hidden patterns in the data

**AtmoAI** aims to:
- Detect atmospheric anomalies in near-real-time
- Improve short-term prediction accuracy using ML
- Support alert systems for air quality or extreme weather events

## üß† AI Approach

### Input Data
- Ground-based measurements (e.g., PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, SO‚ÇÇ, temperature, humidity)
- Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), cloud properties, etc.
- Meteorological data (wind speed, pressure, temperature)
- Model output from chemical transport or weather models (e.g., ECMWF, SILAM)

### Algorithms and Techniques
- **Unsupervised learning** (e.g. autoencoders, clustering) for anomaly detection
- **Time series forecasting** using:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)
  - GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
  - Prophet or ARIMA (for baselines)
- **Supervised regression** to predict pollutant concentrations or visibility
- **Hybrid approach**: combining physics-based models with machine learning residuals

## üß™ Key Features
- Detect abnormal changes in air quality or meteorological parameters
- Forecast pollutant levels 1‚Äì48 hours ahead
- Visualize temporal and spatial patterns
- Trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded (for health or climate relevance)

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for neural networks)
- NetCDF4 / xarray (for atmospheric data formats)
- Cartopy / Matplotlib / Plotly (for geospatial visualizations)
- Streamlit or Dash (for building an interactive web app)

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and MAE for forecasting
- Precision and recall for anomaly detection
- Spatial accuracy of pollutant plume reconstruction

## üöÄ Future Extensions
- Integrate with sensor networks (e.g., PurpleAir or EU AQ monitoring stations)
- Incorporate satellite data with deep learning (CNNs on AOD maps)
- Apply model to specific regions (e.g., Helsinki, Shanghai, Arctic)
- Use transfer learning to generalize models across continents or seasons

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Why This Project?

As a student in atmospheric sciences, I am deeply interested in how AI can complement traditional models in understanding and predicting complex atmospheric processes. This project not only has scientific relevance but also potential real-world impact in public health, environmental policy, and climate research.
